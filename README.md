# About The Project
## Bank Churn Prediction
This repository contains a project for Model Deployment Mid Exam (4th Semester). The goal is to build a predictive machine learning model and deploy the model using Streamlit about customer churn.

## Files
* The main file used in this repository is the MD_UTS_2602075491_BRANDONRITCHIEYANG.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file. The file contains the code for data preparation, data analysis, feature engineering, modelling, and evaluation
* The file Model_Deployment_OOP.py Python file is the OOP version of the main jupyter notebook file.
* The file used for deploying the model is the model_prediction.py Python file where it contains the code for deploying the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this repository is the data_A.csv where the data contains the tabular information about the customer in a Bank. The dataset is provided by the lecturer.

## Libraries
* The libraries required to run the Jupyter Notebook and the OOP code are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, and pickle.
* The libraries required to deploy the model are streamlit, joblib, numpy, and pandas.
